This initial pass is not going to win the competition, but hopefully it can serve as a starting point or, at the very least, you can learn something new along with me.\n",

You will need to accept the terms of the competition to proceed with downloading the data.\n",

    "Just in case you are new, how does all this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Kaggle competitions will come with training and testing data for you to build a model on, where both the training and testing data comes with labels so you can fit a model. Then there will be actual \"blind\" or \"out of sample\" testing data that you will actually use your model on, which will spit out an output CSV file with your predictions based on the input data. This is what you will upload to kaggle, and your score here is what you compete with. There's always a sample submission file in the dataset, so you can see how to exactly format your output predictions.\n",

    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "You can submit up to 3 entries a day, so you want to be very happy with your model, and you are at least slightly disincentivised from trying to simply fit the answer key over time. It's still possible to cheat. If you do cheat, you wont win anything, since you will have to disclose your model for any prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, you can submit 2 final submissions (allowing you to compete with 2 models if you like).\n",
    "This current competition is a 2 stage competition, where you have to participate in both stages to win. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stage one has you competing based on a validation dataset. At the release of stage 2, the validation set answers are released and then you make predictions on a new test set that comes out at the release of this second stage.\n",

    "## About this specific competition ##\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the aim here is to take the sample data, consisting of low-dose CT scan information, and predict what the liklihood of a patient having lung cancer is. Your submission is scored based on the log loss of your predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is pretty large at ~140GB just in initial training data, so this can be somewhat restrictive right out of the gate. I am going to do my best to make this tutorial one that anyone can follow within the built-in Kaggle kernels\n",

Our dataset is only 1500 (even less if you are following in the Kaggle kernel) patients, and will be, for example, 20 slices of 150x150 image data if we went off the numbers we have now, but this will need to be even smaller for a typical computer most likely. \n",
